# Test Plan

This document lists cases to be tested for Laboratory Results in FHIR Format.   

Work in progress; following may not be complete:

* References to (Macsys) test protocols and example FHIR files
* Last chapters still need to be written out
* Per test case, the  acceptance criteria are listed.  Implied is "sender is compliant with requirement, sender does not abend (crash, stop executing) or log error messages on the case, receiver does not abend upon or log error messages upon reception of the FHIR file(s) for the test case
* To detail per case, whether the case is relevant to the visualisation tool or not (some cases are only relevant to GP software or hospital systems).  Cases are flagged when not relevant to visualiser
* There are no references yet to MIPS test protocols and example FHIR files

  

## 1.	Structure & Conventions

1A: Results on different levels in hierarchy; panels and “titles” on different sublevels.  Including very complex structures (fruit & food allergies).
* Test files:
  * https://github.com/hl7-be/hl7-be-fhir-laboratory-report/tree/master/testing/Macsys/815333049
  * https://github.com/hl7-be/hl7-be-fhir-laboratory-report/tree/master/testing/MIPS/UZG_scenario1
* Acceptance criterion:
  * Title headings and levels match those in pfd version of protocol 

1B: RBC/Glucose in different specimen (Blood/urine/CSF)
* Test files: 
  * https://github.com/hl7-be/hl7-be-fhir-laboratory-report/tree/master/testing/Macsys/815333050
  * https://github.com/hl7-be/hl7-be-fhir-laboratory-report/tree/master/testing/MIPS/UZG_scenario1
* Acceptance criterion:
  *  Results clearly indicate which type of sample they refer to (Urine vs blood vs CSF)  

1C: BundleId and DiagnosticReportId conform to Belgian HL7 standards
* Test files:
  *  (need a set that has different versions of the protocol)
* Acceptance criteria:
  *  BundleId is lab riziv number +  "." + laboratory unique identifier; unique for every bundle (i.e. across different versions of the same protocol)
  *  DiagnosticReportId is lab riziv number + "." + laboratory unique identifier unique to the protocol, but identical for different versions of same protocol.

**This test case is not relevant for/not tested by visualisation tool**

## 6.	Edits on Protocol Level

**This whole section is not relevant for/not tested by visualisation tool**

6A-6F Mips: https://github.com/hl7-be/hl7-be-fhir-laboratory-report/tree/master/testing/MIPS/UZG_scenario6

6A: Protocol with partial results followed by same protocol with final results
* Test files:
  * https://github.com/hl7-be/hl7-be-fhir-laboratory-report/tree/master/testing/Macsys/815333047
* Acceptance criteria
  * Upon reception of preliminary report, any missing or unconfirmed results are flagged as such:
    * Composition.status == "preliminary"
    * Observation.1.0.0.0.status="draft"
  * Upon reception of final report, all data is present, and previously data flagged as missing or unconfirmed is no longer available as such or is (e.g. in an audit trail facility) clearly flagged as no longer valid.
  
6B: Protocol with final results, followed by same protocol with amended result (correction of an individual analysis)
* Test files:
  * TBD
* Acceptance criteria
  * After reception of the first version of the protocol, receiver shows initial test results
  * After reception of the second version (revision) of the protocol, receiver now shows amended results (the ones from the second FHIR, no longer the ones from the original FHIR). Original result data is no longer available or is (e.g. in an audit trail facility) clearly flagged as no longer valid.

6C: Final protocol for Patient A, followed by correction of same protocol, but different patient B (patient inversion)
* Test files:
  * TBD
* Acceptance criteria
  * After reception of the first version of the protocol, receiver shows results for patient A
  * After reception of the second version (revision) of the protocol, receiver now shows teh data for patient B.   Previously avaialable data for patient A is either no longer available in the receiving system, or is (e.g. in an audit trail facility) clearly flagged as no longer valid.

6D: Testing of version numbering: retransfer of same protocol, with different version number but otherwise identical data
* Test files:
  * TBD
* Acceptance criteria
  * Data available for the protocol is identical before and after retransfer (even though the version number is higher)

6E:  Changes in administrative data: prescription date, date of birth, sex of patient, 
* Test files:
  * TBD
* Acceptance criteria
  * After reception of the first version of the protocol, receiver shows administrative data as per FHIR
  * After reception of the second version (revision) of the protocol, administrated data is updated, and data pre-update is no longer available or is (e.g. in an audit trail facility) clearly flagged as being out of date

6F:  Second version of the protocol received before the first version
* Test files:
  * TBD
* Acceptance criteria
  * Upon reception of a protocol, for which the receiver had already received a later version, the data in the receiver system is not updated.  I.e. any data in the older version of the protocol shall not overwrite data from the newer version of the protocol.

9B.  Case for additional level of detail (not applicable to Macsys)
TBD

## 10.	Anapath

10A: Protocol with Pathology + Clinical Biology
* Test files:
  * https://github.com/hl7-be/hl7-be-fhir-laboratory-report/tree/master/testing/Macsys/815333059
* Acceptance criteria

* Acceptance criteria:
  * Receiver captures pathology result as in relevant pfd version of the protocol 

## 11.	Protocols in different languages

11A: 2 versions of same protocol, in 2 different languages
* Test files:
  * TBD
* Acceptance criteria:
  * Structurally and data-wise, both FHIR messages are identical
  * Text-wise, each FHIR is in relevant language, and language differences are identical, content-wise (the same is said in both languages, give and take nuances of translation)

## 12. Joint example from multiple labs for same subject

**This whole section is not relevant for/not tested by visualisation tool**

12A: CMA+AKL

Case is as follows: AKL and CMA are 2 differen labs (2 RIZIV/INAMI numbers). But they use the same analysis encoding, methodolgies, reference ranges etc.  Results from both labs can safely be plotted cumulatively.  Test data consists of 2 protocols for the same patient, generated by different laboratory.
* Test files
  * TBD 
* Acceptance criteria:
  * Receiving system is able to produce cumulative patient report, with values for same analysis plotted on the same line for comparison.  Cumulative report result values match those of the individual protocols (which match what is in the FHIR message per test case in $2 of this plan)

12B:  iLab and MIPS

Case is as follows: MIPS and iLabs are never used at the same time by the same lab.   Whether analyses may be plotted cumulatively depends on LOINC encoding, units etc.
* Test files:
  * TBD
* Acceptance criteria: 
  * Receiving system is able to produce cumulative patient report, with values for same analysis in combination with same LOINC encoding, plotted on the same line for comparison.  Cumulative report result values match those of the individual protocols (which match what is in the FHIR message per test case in $2 of this plan)

## 13. Stress Testing

For this chapter we provide xamples of extreme protocols, either with extreme number of analyses, or extremely large annexes.  Functionally, the examples below do not add any additional functionality to be tested (i.e. all cases in these protocols are tested in earlier test steps; here we are merely testinng volumes and complexity).

* Test files:
  * Macsys FIDLAB example: TBD - without annex
* Acceptance criterium
  *  Generating system manages to output the FHIR messages (no memory or timing issues)
  *  Receiving system manages to process the FHIR messages (no memory or timing issues)

## 14. Transmission via eHealthbox

**This whole section is not relevant for/not tested by visualisation tool**

* Test files:
  * Any FHIR message can be used
* Acceptance criteria:
  * Message successfully leaves sender system
  * Message successfully arrives @ receiver system
  * Message received equals message sent
  * Metadata encoded in the ADR XML is LAB-FHIR (not 100% certain yet!)
