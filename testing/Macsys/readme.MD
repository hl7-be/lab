## Test Case Data for FHIR Laboratory Results

All examples are grouped in directories, named by order number and are in json (no XMLs).  Every example has one or more json FHIR file and corresponding pdf of protocol.  Some examples have more than one version of the json file (different FHIR bundles).  For some, examples HTML of the visualizer output may be provided as well.    

Every directory has a ReadMe which lists a ll test cases that apply to the examples.  Full test cases with acceptance criteria are in the Test Plan in the testing folder: https://github.com/hl7-be/hl7-be-fhir-laboratory-report/blob/master/testing/Test%20Plan.MD
