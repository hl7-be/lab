						<p>This example is presented as a Collection bundle for ease of understanding. It makes no assumption towards any final implementation of using FHIR technically. </p>

						<p>ALL LOINC, SNOMED-CT CODES ETC. ARE USED FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES AND DO NOT NECESSARILY PRESENT A CLINICALLY CORRECT REAL LIFE LABORATORY REPORT</p>
						<h2>A narrative SHALL be included</h2>
						<p>Specifically, the strong recommendation of HL7 concerning the use of the narrative &quot;to support human-consumption as a fallback&quot; is important in the context of the laboratory report. Indeed, this &quot;human-consumption&quot; aspect actually concerns the inclusion of limited xhtml content and as such an effortless implementation to visualize the content of the report by consuming systems is guarantueed. Also, for systems that might not initially choose to consume reports in a structured way, this guarantuees a way to at least visualize and present the content to the user.</p>
						<p>Here follow just some draft example structures of what shape a narrative might take and what tags might be used. The exact presentation is left at the discretion of the providing party.</p>

Notes:
The choice of what observations to categorize under what specialty are left ultimately to the discretion of the laboratory sending the results. Some non-restrictive guidelines:
o 18721-1 (THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING STUDIES) will be used for a section carrying pharmacologyobservations on a patient.
o Mycology and parasitology, as well as bacteriology, are part of the 18725-2 (MICROBIOLOGY STUDIES) specialty.
o 665 Virology MAY be included in 18725-2 (MICROBIOLOGY STUDIES) specialty or 18727-8 (SEROLOGY STUDIES)or split between both specialties, depending upon the Content Creator Actor’s choice
