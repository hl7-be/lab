# Although fhirVersions is 0..* in the ImplementationGuide resource
# it can be a single item OR and array here (but so far SUSHI only
# supports 4.0.1 anyway).
fhirVersion: 4.0.1

# The following two lines correspond to items that used to be in
# ig.ini but were moved to IG.definition.parameter. For
# consistency within this file, the names are represented using
# camelcase, but if authors use the formal parameter names, SUSHI
# will recognize them as well. In either case, they'll be copied
# to the IG JSON using the formal names.

# The publisher can be a single item or a list, each with a name and
# optional url and/or email. The first publisher's name will be used
# as IG.publisher.  The contact details and/or additional publishers
# will be translated into IG.contact values.

# The jurisdiction can be a single item or a list. The FHIR Shorthand
# code syntax can be used here.

jurisdiction: urn:iso:std:iso:3166#BE "Belgium"
#jurisdiction: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm#056 "Belgium"


# The dependencies property corresponds to IG.dependsOn. The key is the
# package id and the value is the version (or dev/current). For advanced
# use cases, the value can be an object with keys for `uri` and `version`.
#dependencies:
#  hl7.fhir.us.core: 3.1.0
#  hl7.fhir.us.mcode:
#    id: mcode
#    uri: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.us.mcode
#    version: 1.0.0


dependencies:
  hl7.fhir.be.core: 2.0.0
  hl7.fhir.be.core-clinical: 1.0.0

# The global property corresponds to the IG.global property, but it
# uses the type as the YAML key and the profile as its value. Since
# FHIR does not explicitly disallow more than one profile per type,
# neither do we; the value can be a single profile URL or an array
# of profile URLs.
#global:
#  Patient: http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/my-patient-profile
#  Encounter: http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/my-encounter-profile

# The resources property corresponds to IG.definition.resource.
# SUSHI can auto-generate all of the resource entries based on
# the FSH definitions and/or information in any user-provided
# JSON or XML resource files. If the generated entries are not
# sufficient or complete, however, the author can add entries
# here. If the reference matches a generated entry, it will
# replace the generated entry. If it doesn't match any generated
# entries, it will be added to the generated entries. The format
# follows IG.definition.resource with the following differences:
#   * use IG.definition.resource.reference.reference as the YAML key
#   * specify "omit" to omit a FSH-generated resource from the
#     resource list.
#   * groupingId can be used, but top-level groups syntax may be a
#     better option (see below).
# The following are simple examples to demonstrate what this might
# look like:
#resources:
#  Patient/my-example-patient:
#    name: My Example Patient
#    description: An example Patient
#    exampleBoolean: true
#  Patient/bad-example: omit

# Groups can control certain aspects of the IG generation.  The IG
# documentation recommends that authors use the default groups that
# are provided by the templating framework, but if authors want to
# use their own instead, they can use the mechanism below.  This will
# create IG.definition.grouping entries and associate the individual
# resource entries with the corresponding groupIds.
#groups:
#  GroupA:
#    name: Group A
#    description: The Alpha Group
#    resources:
#    - StructureDefinition/animal-patient
#    - StructureDefinition/arm-procedure
#  GroupB:
#    name: Group B
#    description: The Beta Group
#    resources:
#    - StructureDefinition/bark-control
#    - StructureDefinition/bee-sting

# The pages property corresponds to IG.definition.page. SUSHI can
# auto-generate the page list, but if the author includes pages in
# this file, it is assumed that the author will fully manage the
# pages section and SUSHI will not generate any page entries.
# The page file name is used as the key. If title is not provided,
# then the title will be generated from the file name.  If a
# generation value is not provided, it will be inferred from the
# file name extension.  Any subproperties that are valid filenames
# with supported extensions (e.g., .md/.xml) will be treated as
# sub-pages.

# The ImplementationGuide resource defines several other properties
# not represented above. These properties can be used as-is and
# should follow the format defined in ImplementationGuide:
# * meta
# * implicitRules
# * language
# * text
# * contained
# * extension
# * modifierExtension
# * experimental
# * useContext
# * copyright
# * packageId

# The menu property will be used to generate the input/menu.xml file.
# The menu is represented as a simple structure where the YAML key
# is the menu item name and the value is the URL. The IG publisher
# currently only supports one level deep on sub-menus.
# To provide a custom menu.xml file, do not include this property and
# include a `menu.xml` file in input/includes.

# The parameters property represents IG.definition.parameter. Rather
# than a list of code/value pairs (as in the ImplementationGuide
# resource), the code is the YAML key. If a parameter allows repeating
# values, the value in the YAML should be a sequence/array. For a
# partial list of allowed parameters see:
